* Do all of the above within 10-20 years

* Whoever discovers a new land gets to claim it (European rule)

Bartolome de las Casas
* A Dominican
* Visits a couple missions and talks to the priests to report on it
* He is shocked with what he discovers and writes about it
* Reports on abuse on some Priests and soliders.
* Confidential report to the Pope to tell him that we need to get our act right

The Black Legend
* The letter leaked, and so the other Europeans had an excuse to conquer the Americas
* Negate Spain's right of discovery due to the abuse of Native Americans

Four Main Charges against California Missions
* They lasted a lot longer than 20 years
* Free lands and free labor, the missions became wealthy
* Franciscans did not make many strides teaching Native Americans how to read or write. Many questioned if the NA were converted sincerely.
* Labor system of the mission demanded physical coercion. Priests whipped the Native Americans.

What attracted Indians into the Mission
* Curiosity
* Free gifts - Little books, saints medals, fresh bread
* Manipulation - Make promises to people with sick children
* Kidnapping

Defender of the Missions - Fr. Maynard F Geiger O.F.M.
