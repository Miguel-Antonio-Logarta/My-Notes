Defender of the Missions Fr. Maynard F. Geiger OFM
* Wrote on Father Serra and worked to get Serra sanctified. He supported the California missions
* Recieved PHD from Catholic University of America (Washington DC)
* Work based on writings of Fr. Estevan Tapis OFM who was head prist of the
  Santa Barbara missions in 1805

Geiger's Arguments
* Joining the mission was voluntary
* Work schedule was pretty mild
* Priests allowed Native Americans to visit their home villages on a
  regular basis
* Physical coercion (ex: the whip) was only used as a last resort
* Pagan Indians had more freedom, but missions Indians had food, shelter, clothing,
  and best of all, the Catholic faith
* Geiger likens the mission to working for a large corporation

Dr. Sherburne F. Cook
* Not a priest, but a physiologist
* Got his Ph. D. from Harvard
* Made a lot of essays criticizing the missions
* California missions had to be self-reliant. They needed Native American workers.
* Native Americans had different styles of working. They only worked when they had to
* They worked really hard if the environment demanded it, then they relaxed when 
  the environment allowed them to
* Whipping was common during the 18th century. Most often used by the white race
  against the "lesser races"
* Whipping ineffective: caused hatred instead of obedience

Cook's Numbers
* 1809-1817 records were completed
* 20 missions with 1000 Indians in each mission
* 71 floggins (whippings), 
* 75 floggings with imprisonment, 
* 46 imprisonments, 
* 17 executions
* Roughly one flogging per mission per year
* Death rate very high, birth rate very low
* Disease #1 killer by a long shot. Suicide is #2
* Even though it was punished, Native American mothers were practicing abortion

Fr Francis Guest OFM
* Eager to see Fr Junipero Serra sanctified
* Defender of the missions
* What was the essential problems of California missions?
  * Was the problem of the missions trying to impose European values onto Native American cultures?
  * Were the Spanish missionaries judging Native American societies by European values and finding them lacking?
  * "Aren't modern day critics doing the exact same thing? 
     Aren't we judging the Catholic missionaries by our cultural values and condemning the priests?"

Five Reasons to force the Native Americans to stay at the mission
1. Native Americans needed daily religious instruction
2. Missionaries were trying to "civilize" the Native Americans
3. Native Americans needed effective moral training. Native American villages were hotbeds of immoral practices
4. Avoiding the chance to sin
5.
