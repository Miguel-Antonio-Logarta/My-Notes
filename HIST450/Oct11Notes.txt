The Scheme
* Trump was pretty sure he was going to lose the election

* The hope was that Pence would say "We have two sets of electors from various states. I am not going to count those votes until it can be resolved"
* That left the door open to several possibilities
* Trump's fake electors are declared legit, or
* Biden doesn't get clear majority of college votes. It goes down to states, each state delegation gets one vote, Trump would've won that contents
