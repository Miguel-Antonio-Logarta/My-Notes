* If n1 starts with a 0, ignore the 0 and go to the next bit
* If n2 starts with a 0, ignore the 0 and go to the next bit

These test cases are wrong
110$011 -> 110 = 011
110$011 -> 110 = 011

Expected result is 110$011 -> 110>011

Put a transition state between n10 and "find 0". This transition
state will skip the leading zeroes after the $ sign

V with a line going through it means "for all"
