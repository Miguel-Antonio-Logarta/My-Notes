Based on the mystery PDA provided, I found that:

1. The string can (optionally) start with a combination of A's and T's, but it has to be even.
2. There is a substring of G's and C's in the middle of the string. The number
    of G's have to be odd while the number of C's have to be even 
3. The number of A's and T's at the end (optional) have to match the number of A's and T's at the beginning of the string.
    However, this total number must also be divisible by 3
4. Based on rules 1 and 4, the total number of A's and T's have to be divisible by both
    2 and 3. So the total number has to be multiples of 6.

Σ = {A,T,G,C}
L = {
    w: xyz
    x: ΣAT* where #A's in x + #C's in x % 2 == 0
                  #A's in x + #C's in x >= 0,
    y: ΣGC* where #G's % 2 == 1 and #C's % 2 == 0,
    x: ΣAT* where #A's in z + #C's in z % 3 == 0
                  #A's in z + #C's in z >= 0,
}
