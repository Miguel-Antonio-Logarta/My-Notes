To start testing the input, go to input>step. Enter your input. 101110 or some other 1 and 0 will work.
click the step button on the bottom to traverse the algorithm step by step
In the lab, we see that each arrow has values over the arrow.
  3:3:R probably means that we will go through in this direction if the input is a "3" and we will change that value to a "3",
    Then go to the next character of the input string (R) (If the last value is L instead of R, it means we go back one character)
  If the value shows a square as the input square:square:R then that means that we will branch in this direction if we reached the end of the input string.
