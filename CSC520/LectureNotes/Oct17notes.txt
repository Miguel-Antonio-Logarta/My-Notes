SAT - Satifisfiability
Any NP problem can be reduced to an NP complete problem

2-SAT, Shortest Path, isPrime is a P problem
SAT, 3-SAT, CircuitSAT, DHC, UHC, TSP is NP complete
HaltEx is exp (exponential)
YesOnSome is NP hard


Clique vs Node cover
In the node cover, you take the complement of the clique. You remove the old edges and connect all of the missing edges (Slide 10 of the presentation)

If F is an element of NP, then F <=P G
Is G an element of NP?

<=P means poly reduced
G could be in NP, but not necessarily.
SAT <=P YesOnSome, and YesOnSome is uncomputable. Not only 
can it not be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time, it cannot be solved at all!
