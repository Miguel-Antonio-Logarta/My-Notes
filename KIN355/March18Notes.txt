Fatigue
- Inability to maintain a task despite trying to continue
- Physical and mental
- Physical wear and tear, stress on bones, muscles, and joints
- Loss of motivation

Causes of Physical Fatigue
- PCr Depletion
- Glycogen Depletion
- Hypoglycemia
- Hypothermia / hyporthermic shock
- Hyperthermia
- Metabolic Acidosis

When exercise begins:
- PCr provides energy for the first 8 seconds
- Anaerobic or Aerobic system takes over

Glycogen Depleted:
- PCr will also be depleted
- Ability to maintain effort is limited
- Aerobic system takes over

Rest:
- Cellular PCr levels regenerate after 3 minutes

Creatine is synthesized in the liver

We usually have at most 2 hours of glycogen stores

Mechanical Damage - Tissues are physically "beat up" during long endurance exercises
Central Nervous Fatigue - Neuromuscular fatigue. May be caused by biochemical changes. Nerves not transferring signal from brain to muscles

Fatigue vs Overtraining
- Fatigue: Inability to continue a task.
  - Temporary, and is a normal response to long exercise
- Overtraining: Maladaptations that decrease person's ability to perform at a high level
  - Abnormal response to extended periods of overreaching in physical activity
  - Occurs over time and hampers training progress
  - Persistent and may even take months to recover or reverse the severity

Causes of Overtraining
- Occurs when recovery is not balanced with training 
- Single training session that has significantly higher training load than usual
- Multiple back to back training sessions
- Multiple high training load sessions
- Inadequate recovery

Overreaching vs Functional overreaching
- No overreaching = maintenance
- Functional overreaching = overreaching with a long period of recovery after (good thing)
