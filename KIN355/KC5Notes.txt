Making a good training plan
* Volume: Amount of training over a period of time (number of reps over a period of time, usually one week)
* Intensity: How difficult the training is (%Max, RPE, HR Zone, etc...)
* Training Load: How much stress to the body (e.g. how much weight you lift)
* Presecribed Training: Modality, sets, reps, and intensity
* Autoregulation: Keeping track of one's own workout plan and making sure it works

RPE: Rate of Perceived Exertion

Five Principles of Training
1. Individuality: Sex, age, diet, sleep, schedule, etc..., genetics
2. Specifity: min/max training specific for your goals (etc... bodybuilder, combat sports, or basketball player?)
3. Reversibility: Training to prevent loss of gains. Usually should train 2-3 days a week
4. Progressive Overload: Small increases in intensity and load for progress
    If you train too much, you will "plateau" and that's bad
5. Variation: Varied training to maximize adaptation

General Conditioning should happen at the beginning of the training plan before anything else
Properly designed training plans DO include periods of functional overreaching (it has to be planned with long periods of rest)

When a person starts to lift weights, they will likely gain size quickly and those gains will diminish quickly
Make sure to consult the protein diagram
Compression clothing might work because it: feels good to wear it, it influences blood flow, it stabilizes soft tissue

Macrocycle - The entire 52 week period of your training program. Contains all 4 block periodizations
Mesocycle - specific block of training within the season. Designed to accomplish a single goal (e.g. Increase endurance)
Microcycle - Shortest training cycle. Usually a week. It's a focused block of training
