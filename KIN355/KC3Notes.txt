AEROBIC vs ANAEROBIC ENERGY SYSTEMS

Aerobic Energy system
* Uses oxygen
* Lots of energy per cycle
* Cycles slowly
* Used for low-mod energy demands
-> Uses carbs, fat, and protein for fuel
-> doesn't produce lactate
-> aerobic respiration
* fat -> keytones
* protein -> urea


Anaerobic Energy System
* Doesn't use Oxygen
* Provides little energy per cycle
* Cycles quickly
* Used for higher energy demands
-> carbs as fuel
-> produces lactate
-> fermentation

phosphocreatine
-> explosive energy that lasts 7 seconds max

EFFECTS of SLEEP

* Allows heart to rest (heart rate changes)
* Prevents illnesses (produces cytokines, hormones that help immune system)
* Better mental state

What happens without sleep?
* Worse accuracy
* Less stamina
* Bad reaction time
* Can't learn
* Increased chances for illness
