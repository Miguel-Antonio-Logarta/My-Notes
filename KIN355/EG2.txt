Prompts for Anyone...

    Do you take or use any supplements? If so, which ones?
    What are your perceptions of the value you get out of the supplements you take? How well do they work?
    Do you drink energy drinks? What do they do for you?
    After our lecture on energy drinks, what are your thoughts about them?

I do not take or use any supplements. I do not do a$ny type of physical activity that would require me to take supplements.

Prompts for Non-Gym Goers...

    Do you do any kind of working out at home for your strength or fitness? If so, what do you do?
    What are you main reasons for NOT going to the gym?
    What is something you would like to know about using the gym that might encourage you to go?

I used to go to the gym, but because of school and work, I had to stop going. I would go regularly 4 times a week using and I would split it into upper and lower body workouts. I stopped when I realized that both work and school would cause me to not get enough sleep, which prevented me from making progress in the gym.

Right now, even though I do not go to the gym, I'm still engaging in physical activity. I would regularly play this rhythm game called Dance Dance Revolution which burns a lot of calories while also being fun to play. You have to use your feet to play and time your steps to the beat. It takes up less time, and also keeps my weight down.

If I could go back to the gym, I would in a heartbeat, but right now I am too busy to be fully invested.
