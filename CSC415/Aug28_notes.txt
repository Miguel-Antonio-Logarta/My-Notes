* Hex goes from 0 to F and has 16 digits.
* A 64-bit computer uses 8 byte memory addresses. It means 8 bytes per pointer

A char is 8 bits, so 1 byte
An int is 4 bytes 
C is a pointer, so it is 8 bytes
X is an array, of ints, so 5*4 bytes = 20 bytes of memory

Summary:
char = 8 bits = 1 byte
int = 32 bits = 4 bytes (usual case)
pointer = 64 bits = 8 bytes
arrays size = sizeof(type)*arrayLength in bytes

int* y;
y = malloc(5*sizeof(int)) <- Allocate memory of 5*4 = 20 bytes
