When I first started programming, I thought I wanted to become a video game designer since I found making games to be super fun and fulfilling. However, over time, I gradually became more interested in web design. I wanted to learn every part of the creating a web application. From the back end to the front end, designing everything by hand was a very fun process. Nowadays, I want to become a fullstack software developer. I feel like this class will affect my career in a good way because it will teach me how the operating system will work at a low level, which I feel is very important if you want to run a server on your own.
