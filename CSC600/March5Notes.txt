* Type conversions are expensive
* Each compiler has a different way of dealing with matrices and are optimized differently.
  Some are faster with row access, while others are faster with column access

* There are 8*6=48 ways to write C=A*B
48 vrsion fo Matrix Multiplication

Recursion vs Iteration

Problems
1. Data types and formats
  Precision of real numbers, signed and unsigned integers

2. Syntax notation
  BNF, EBNF, syntax diagrams, parenthetic notation
 ::= assignment, <> object, | exclusive or, 1 terminal symbol
  <octal> ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 <octal><digit> | 0 <octal>
  
  EBNF
  = assignment, | exlusive or, () grouping, [] zero or more, {} zero or more instances (repetition), "1" terminal symbol
  
  Syntax diagram
  circle = terminal symbol

  Parenthetic notation
  [] optional element
  {} select one of components (exlusive or)
  ... repeat last unit any number of times
  1 terminal symbol
