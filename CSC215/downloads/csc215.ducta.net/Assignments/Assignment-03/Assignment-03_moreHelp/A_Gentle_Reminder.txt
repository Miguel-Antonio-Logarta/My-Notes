Hello, Team,

We want to reread the Grader's Grading Expectations and Policies to avoid losing points. This important document is in the File Manager/Assignments directory. 

The other ducuments, as we discussed many times in class, are also there to help us: the Guidelines for All Assignments, the Assignment Report Template, and etc. 

We want to start all assignments early and reach out to the grader on time for clarification. 

Happy programming and have fun! 
		
Best,
Duc
