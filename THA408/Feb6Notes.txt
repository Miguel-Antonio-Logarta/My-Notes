The development of Noh
Gagaku and Bukagu, Kagura -> Sangaku and sarugaku -> Dengaku, Dengaku Noh -> sarugaku Noh -> Noh

1374 - 17 year old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu saw Kan'ami and Zeami perform in Kyoto and decided to patronize their art form
Yoshimitsu's patronage set a precedent for Noh as an artistocratic form for the samurai class
- Noh became super formal with high standards
- Noh almost died in the Meiji era when the Tokugawa Samurai political system ended in 1868
- Noh was supported by the imperial government since it appealed to foreigners (Ulysses Grant, Earnest Fenollosa, etc...)
