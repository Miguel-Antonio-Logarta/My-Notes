My name is Miguel Antonio Dela Cruz Logarta.
My gender pronouns are he/him.
I have two first names, but everyone just calls me Miguel, so that's what I roll with.
I am a computer science major. I took this class because the topic of Asian Theatre interests me. I've seen kabuki performances online in Youtube, so I thought learning more about it would be a great idea to immerse myself more into Japanese culture. One fact I know about Japan is that they have the longest reigning royal family in the world. Their lineage goes back to around 600 BC.
Outside of school, I have a few personal hobbies. Currently I am learning to play the piano. It is a difficult instrument to pick up, but I've been consistenly practicing for around a year now. For my entertainment, I like to paly Dance Dance Revolution, which is a dancing game that involves stepping on arrows to the beat of the music.
